In this project, i had to complete a small task.
First, i had to fill two empty map and vector containers with random numbers from 1 to 9,
then i had to delete a random number of elements(no more than 15) in each container. 
Well, after that, synchronize so that only the elements in both containers remain in the vector and the map. 
Let's see what I did
